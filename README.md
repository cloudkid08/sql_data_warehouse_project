## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

🎯 This repository demonstrates skills in:

* SQL Development
* Data Architecture
* Data Engineering
* ETL Pipeline Development

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications

* **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

* **Customer Behavior**
* **Product Performance**
* **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
